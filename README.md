1. Project Overview

VendorBite is a multi-vendor food ordering platform where users can order food from multiple restaurants in one place.
Customers can browse restaurants, add items from different vendors to a single cart, place an order, and track delivery in real time.
Vendors can manage their menus and orders. Delivery personnel can update delivery status. Admin can monitor the full system.

This project aims to make food ordering faster, easier, and more flexible for everyone.
